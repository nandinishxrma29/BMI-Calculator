# BMI-Calculator
The Python BMI Calculator is a simple command-line application that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input of their height and weight in metric units. BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight, and it is commonly used to classify people into different weight categories. This project provides a useful tool to quickly and easily calculate a user's BMI based on their input data.

This project is a great example of how Python and Streamlit can be used to build interactive and user-friendly applications for health tracking and fitness monitoring.
